# **üß¢ Cap - Not a Wallet**

The idea of this project is to explore how can we re think wallets from the groundup and in a mobile native way?
Most existing wallets offer stright forward functionality and the interface has become super familiar to the crypto natives and tech-savvy audience. But is that the right way to onboard the upcoming 100's of millions to billions who are yet to use dapps and play d-games?

Few pointers about Cap

-   All Cap experiments will be run on the Aptos blockchain for now.
-   Cap will not launch a wallet which looks and works the same way most traditional crypto wallets do. (If you are looking for an Aptos wallet to use now - Martian and Petra are good choices).
-   Cap will be designed and developed with a mobile-first mindset.

### **The Plan**

1. The plan is to design and devlop a new kind of crypto wallet that will focus more making it is to use dapps, decentralized games and be simple for the masses.
2. Will start designing various ideas about how crypto wallet could be better, and updating this README about any progress.
3. If you have any idea or design to share, open an issue using the "idea" tag.
4. Currently, all ideas will be experimented on the Aptos blockchain only.
